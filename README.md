# Haptic and Augmented Reality Visual Cues for Remote Manipulation via Motion Tracking Interface
Here we organize the source code for the robot control interface using the HTC Vive handheld controller as well as the haptic and AR visual cues to represent four types of information critical to the reach-and-grasp remote manipulation task.
